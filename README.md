ðŸ“¸ Real-Time Face Recognition and Logging System
A real-time face detection and recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit, designed to capture, log, and search unique human faces using a live webcam feed.

This project is optimized to store only one image per person per minute, reducing redundancy and ensuring clean, high-quality face data logging. It also includes a searchable interface that allows users to upload or capture a photo and find matches from previously captured faces.

 Saves only unique faces (1 per person per minute)

 CSV-based logging with timestamp, image path, and encoding

 Face search via image upload or live capture
